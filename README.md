## Contact Form

Form submissions are captured in the Leads app. The form is also connected to https://formsubmit.co/ which will require activation. To activate, submit a test submission and you will receive an activation email to the email configured in the instance's Contact Form settings.

## Blog Articles
Create articles and organize them by categories. Each category will have its own unique page where articles that contain that tag will be displayed. Each article will also have an author with its own unique page where all articles written by that author will display.

## Ready for desktop and mobile
This template has been optimized to display on any device!


## Bottom Loading Javascript
This template works best if your instance's JavaScript is loaded at the end of the html `body` rather than in the `head` element. Be sure to go to Settings > Developer and set `Automatically include JavaScript in head` to `NO`
